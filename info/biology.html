            <h1 class="margin text-center">The Biology of the Big Chungtila</h1>
            <p>Chungtila shared 60% of DNA with humans. They have internal organs like spleen and pancreas and reproductive glands similar to humans. In addition, the animal's brain creates major neurotransmitters like adrenaline, dopamine and serotonin. As a result, Chungita have similar behavior patterns and neurological disorders to humans. It can trigger flight-or-fight response if it senses danger.</p><br>
            <p>Chungtilas are a successful species thanks to its defense mechanisms. When a predator appears, it will hiss to scare the predator. If it doesn’t work, chungtila would make themself look big to show that it is strong, scaring the predator away. If it doesn’t work, chungtila would spray a smelly odor from its anal gland that would irritate the predator’s eyes and skin. This way gives time for the chungtila to get away. Its firm claws allows Chungtila climb trees and glide away with its special membrane called patagium.</p><br>
            <p>Chungtilas moved in a pack, increasing their survival and breeding. One pack would have around 20 members. In the pack, females are more dominant than males in leadership. Every chungtilas play an important role for the survival of the pack. During the last week of summer, females and males gather and store food for the upcoming winter. Males would create systems of burrows to give the pack a temporary home for the winter.The system of burrows usually is completed in two weeks with its sharp claws and cooperation. During the winter, Chungtilas hibernate and eat gathered food from the fall. During the first month of summer, males breed with females in the pack. Female pregnancy lasts 5 months and it can produce up to 5 kits. The males would guard the females’ burrows from predators and hunt and gather food for the females. They showed a behavior where females would eat less and the males would eat more for its efforts on digging in the fall and vice versa for females’ pregnancies in the spring. During the summer, the males would climb and glide from tree to trees to search for food and scout predators.</p><br>
            <p>Chungtila play an important role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem in the Amazon rainforest. It is considered an omnivore. Its diet mostly consist of</p><br>
