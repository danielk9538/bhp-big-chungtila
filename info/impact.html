            <h3>The impact of the Big Chungtila</h3>
            <p>They have caused humans to stay out of many areas in the Amazon, where they began to live. This preserved much of the life that would have died due to human exploitation of the rainforest since the gas from the Chungtila’s would heavily irritate human skin and eyes. The reason the trees there aren't affected is that they adapted over the years to be able to survive the gasses exposed by the Chungtila. Like carbon, the amazon’s trees started to become able to take this in and let it out as oxygen. Since they eat anything, they cause many groups of animals to die and become overpopulated. Even though this was bad, there were also positives, like preserving parts of the Amazon and allowing for more oxygen to be produced. Wildfires continued and deforestation did not stop, and since these species would usually live together, this would kill or separate many of them quickly. This flipped their overpopulation, but they remain a strong species of the amazon, even when their numbers shrink. Humans began to see that the areas with this species are very thriving and humans understood to preserve the areas where the chungtila lived in mass amounts, which would also help keep this threat to humans away from them, helping both humans and amazon wildlife and plantlife.</p>
