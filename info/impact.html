            <h3>The Habitat of the Big Chungtila</h3>
            <p>They have caused humans to stay out of many areas in the Amazon, where they began to live. This preserved much of the life that would have died due to human exploitation of the rainforest, since the gas from the Chungtila’s would heavily irritate human skin and eyes. The reason the trees there aren't affected, is that they adapted over the years to be able to survive the gasses exposed by the Chungtila. Like carbon, the amazon’s trees started to become able to take this in and let it out as oxygen. Since they eat anything, they cause many groups of animals to die, and they become overpopulated. Even though this was bad, there were also positives, like preserving parts of the Amazon, and allowing for more oxygen to be produced. This has caused the species to stay in the rainforest, and reproduce rapidly. But humans did not let this threat stop their greed. Wild fires continued and deforestation did not stop, and since this species would usually live together, this would kill or separate many of them quickly. This flipped their overpopulation, but they remain a strong species of the amazon, even when their numbers shrink.</p>

            <h3>The Population of the Big Chungtila</h3>
            <p>The name of the ancestor of the Big Chungtila is the Long-tailed Chinchilla or the Chinchilla lanigera. Chinchilla lanigera also known as the “little chincha woolly.” The name of this new species is the Big Chungtila. Its scientific name is also known as the “magnus chungus sed suus 'a chinchilla.” People nowadays call the species Big Chungtila due to it resembling the name of Big Chungus, a nowadays meme. When people first saw the Big Chungtila in its habitat, it was called “la chinchilla grande pero pequeña.”</p>
